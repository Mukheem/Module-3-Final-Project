# Module-3-Final-Project
 This is the Final project for Module 3.

 This is all about a Farmer who was kidnapped and left on a floating Island. Now, He as to collect 5 game objects and then reach the safe house by the time his health runs out. He also should not slide over the floating island.

 Tech used is just Unity 3d and C#.

 There was a lot help taken from Unity APIs,Unity forums and Stackoverflow. Besides those, this page helped me in getting a fair understanding of WaitUntil() conditions. **https://vionixstudio.com/2021/04/03/unity-coroutine-tutorial/#Make_Unity_coroutine_Wait_Until_a_condition_is_true**
